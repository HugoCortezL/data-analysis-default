# Diabetes Prediction Dataset Analysis and Modeling

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis and predictive modeling of a dataset related to diabetes. The dataset includes information about individuals, with features such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and the target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 100,000 entries with the following columns:

1. **gender:** Gender of the individual (male, female, other).
2. **age:** Age of the individual (ranging from 0 to 80).
3. **hypertension:** Binary indicator (0 or 1) for the presence of hypertension.
4. **heart_disease:** Binary indicator (0 or 1) for the presence of heart disease.
5. **smoking_history:** Smoking history categories (not current, former, no info, current, never, ever).
6. **bmi:** Body Mass Index (BMI) indicating underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.
7. **HbA1c_level:** Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level indicating the average blood sugar level.
8. **blood_glucose_level:** Blood glucose level indicating the amount of glucose in the bloodstream.
9. **diabetes:** Target variable (0 indicating no diabetes, 1 indicating diabetes).

## Usage

### Notebooks

Explore the dataset using Jupyter Notebooks available in the `notebooks/` directory:

- `01_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Analyzes the distribution and relationships of variables.
- `02_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for cleaning and preprocessing the raw data.
- `03_Feature_Engineering.ipynb`: Notebook for creating new features and transforming existing ones.
- `04_Modeling.ipynb`: Notebook for training and evaluating predictive models.

## Source Code

The `src/` directory contains the following Python scripts:

- `ModelTraining.py`: Script for training machine learning models.
- `Plotter.py`: Script for plotting and visualizing data.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions used in the project.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
